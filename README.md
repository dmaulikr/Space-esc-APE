# Space-esc-APE
This is my first real game and project that I did. I did this after my freshman year. The code is pretty ugly to be honest. But I put it on the App Store and it is still there today! 

You can check it out at https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/space-esc-ape/id1017588879?ls=1&amp;mt=8. 

You can see a video of me playing the game at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJozAkjinXI
